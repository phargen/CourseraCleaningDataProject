# CourseraCleaningDataProject
Repo for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project code, February 2015 https://class.coursera.org/getdata-011/

This code book describes the variables found in the file output generated by the run_analysis.R script in this repository.  For information on the steps the script takes to organize the data, view the accompanying README.md file.

The tidy output file holds the mean measurements for each activity/subject subgroup in the original data set.

The two categorical variables that are used to group feature measurements are:
"Activity"   - The activity the subject was engaged in during measurement.  This is a factor variable choosing from {LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS}
"SubjectNum" - The numeric ID of the subject performing the above activities with a smartphone measurement device attached to their hip.

The following 86 measurement variables have all been normalized between -1 and 1, and are thus unitless.  Since there are so many features listed, each one will not be described individually here.  For a lengthier explanation of the variables, please refer to the original data set explanation found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and in the original README included with the raw data.  A modified portion of this is copied here:

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (Acceleration and GravityAcceleration, respectively) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals in 3 dimensions (AccelerationJerk and GyroJerk). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (*Mag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fft* measurements."
